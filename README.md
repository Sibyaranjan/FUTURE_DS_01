Superstore Sales Dashboard

Project Overview: -

This project focuses on building an interactive Power BI dashboard using the Superstore dataset. The goal was to analyze overall Sales, Profit, and Quantity, and break them down across Segments, Categories, Sub-Categories, Ship Modes, Regions, and States.

Project Workflow: -

1.Data Cleaning & Preparation:-

(i)Processed and structured the Superstore dataset for analysis.

(ii)Created DAX measures for Total Sales, Total Profit, and Total Quantity.

(iii)Ensured consistency in fields like category, region, and ship mode.

2.Dashboard Development:-

(i)Designed KPI cards for overall business metrics:

  Total Sales → 2M

  Total Profit → 286K

  Total Quantity → 38K

(ii)Built multiple visuals for detailed analysis:

  Sales by Segment (Pie Chart)
 
  Sales by Category & Sub-Category (Bar Charts)
 
  Sales by Ship Mode (Pie & Bar Charts)

  Monthly Sales & Profit Trends by Year (Line/Area Charts)

Final Insights:-

1.Overall Performance

(i)Sales: 2M, Profit: 286K, Quantity: 38K.

(ii)Business shows a positive growth trend from 2011 to 2014.

2.Segment Performance

(i)Corporate Segment (31%) leads in sales.

(ii)Home Office (19%) contributes the least.

3.Category & Sub-Category Analysis

(i)Technology (0.84M) is the top category, followed by Furniture (0.74M) and Office Supplies (0.72M).

(ii)Within sub-categories:

  Phones → 330K

  Chairs → 330K

  Storage → 220K

4.Shipping Mode Insights

(i)Standard Class (59%) dominates with 1.4M sales.

(ii)Same Day shipping (~0.1M) is least used, possibly due to higher costs.

5.Regional & Geographic Trends

(i)Strongest sales observed in East and West regions.

(ii)Some states show high sales but lower profit, indicating pricing or discounting issues.

6.Time-Based Trends

(i)Sales and profit consistently peak in Q4 (October–December), showing strong year-end demand.

Conclusion:-

The dashboard highlights that:

1.Technology category and Corporate customers are the main revenue drivers.

2.Standard shipping is the most preferred mode by customers.

3.Q4 is the peak sales season, offering opportunities for targeted promotions.

4.Certain states require profit optimization despite strong sales performance.
